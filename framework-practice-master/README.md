# Framework Practice

This project will serve as a base for us to practice using a Javascript framework.

## TODO

1. Add a framework to the project, get a "hello world" to show up.
2. Use the framework to make displaying all the alligators in list easier. We want to iterate through the list, only have HTML for a single profile, generate it dynamically for each element of the list.
3. Make the header a reusable component.
4. Use the header component on a second page.
5. Add functionality to only show alligators that like ice cream.
6. Add functionality to sort alligators by weight.
7. Let users add their own alligators to the list.
